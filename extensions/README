The workbench is structured identically to the "vendor" directory, but you can add stuff in here adhock for development purposes. It makes developing extensions a little easier. 

- clone Context repo
- get it running
- create extension repo
- add git submodule in workbench for extension
- make extension work
- create release
- add to bower
